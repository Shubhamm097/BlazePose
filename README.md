## Demo
[Check out my smash tracker](https://shubhamm097.github.io/BlazePose/)

## Overview
This project is based in the fitness domain. Through this project, an attempt has been made to track the perfect punch using Google's BlazePose which helps you to give 33 points of your body. Through this one can try the jim routine from work from home in these haed times.

## Motivation
Fitness has always been a part of human's life, we all know about the advantages of a healthy body. And in times like these, it has become even more important to pay all the dues of the body. But, with all the jim's being closed a work from home fitness regime must be followed. Thus, through this app one can track their punches.

## Approach
Google's BlazePose provides us with 33 points on the body alongside the visibility parameter of those points. Thus, one can easily track the hands by combining the two points for a hand each for better results. 

After that an area sort of can be created to track if the punch is being hit in those area or not.

I have used two points for a hand each alongside the visibility parameter for those points to get the better results.

## Run
After downloading the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wQTSNIVk2YRliPCbjavAerzosynNAGng/view?usp=sharing), open a google colab notebook and run the cells.
